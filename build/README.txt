NightFall
=========

A small tray program that can change screen brightness and colour gamma settings
on schedule, in order to achieve a more natural feeling during late hours.

Looking at a lit screen in a dark room can interfere with the sleep cycle,
NightFall can provide a warm-coloured darker screen on desktop and laptop 
computers alike.

Comes with a number of pre-defined brightness and colour themes, you can
also create and save your own themes.


Using The Program
-----------------

NightFall stays in the system tray as a grey or orange moon icon, depending on
being active, dimming the screen on command or according to the set schedule.
Schedule can be set in quarter-hour steps.
